// writing an assertion library
/*

Now let's implement our own assertion library.
Create a function called `expect` that accepts an "actual"
and returns an object of assertions.

Tip: I want to be able to use it like so:

> expect(actual).toBe(expected)

Then run this code with `node 2.todo`

> Make sure you're in the right directory!

 */

const {sum, subtract} = require('./math')

let result, expected

result = sum(3, 7)
expected = 10
expect(result).toBe(expected)

result = subtract(7, 3)
expected = 4
expect(result).toBe(expected)

function expect(actual) {
  return {
    toBe(expected) {
      if (result == expected) {
        console.log('PASSED')
      } else {
        throw new Error(
          `The result of ${result} is not equal to the expected: ${expected}`,
        )
      }
    },
  }
}
